# Overview

I created a fitness leaderboard website that extracts the user's year-to-date distance moved and stores it in the blockchain. Every time the user authenticates with Strava, the distance data is updated and ranked in the leaderboard.

### Key features:

+ OAuth 2.0 for Authentication.
+ APIs, designed using the FastAPI framework, manage communication between the front end and the blockchain.
+ Blockchain for data storage.

### How it works:
